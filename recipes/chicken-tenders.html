        because they are breaded with cheez its and not your usual flour and egg mixture.

        <li>First, remove the tendon from the tenderloin, make sure to wash your chicken</li>

        <li>Put your crushed crackers into a large bowl</li>
        <li>Carefully coat your chicken with the cheez its</li>
        <li>Once they are all coated, layer them on a large baking dish and make sure they are not touching</li>
        <li>Let those set for about 30 minutes so the breading stays on well</li>
        <li>Turn your oven to 350 and cook the chicken tenders for about 30 minutes, turning over halfway through</li>
        <li>Make sure to check that the chicken is cooked all the way through and enjoy with your favorite sauce</li>
