    <img src="./loaded-mash.jpg" height="300" width="250">
    <p>These mashed potatoes are a huge hit! They are made with simple ingredients you probably have in your pantry already</p>
    <p>Farm fresh milk and cheese, salty butter, delicious bacon and chives, Oh my!</p>
    <p>This meal makes a perfect side to our <a href="./chicken-tenders.html">crazy chicken tenders</a></p>
<H3>These are the ingredients you need</H3>
<ul>
    <li>8 large russet potatoes</li>
    <li>Whole milk, 1 cup</li>
    <li>Heavy Cream, 1 cup</li>
    <li>Salted butter, 2 sticks</li>
    <li>Salt, pepper, garlic powder</li>
    <li>1lb of thick cut bacon</li>
    <li>As much green onion as your heart desires, really, go crazy if you want!</li>
    <li>2 cups of cheddar blend cheese</li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow these steps to cheesy,cheesy greatness</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Wash and peel your potatoes, or don't peel them, see if I care</li>
  <li>Now get some water(or chicken broth) boiling on the stove, make sure it is salty like the ocean</li>
  <li>Boil the potatoes until they are fork tender</li> 
  <li>While the potatoes are boiling, cut your bacon into one inch slices and cook it to your desired doneness, we're a crispy bacon household here but really any kind will do</li> 
    <li>Once those potatoes are done, mash them carefully, turning in your milk, cream, and butter until it is as creamy as you prefer. Season them to your taste</li>
    <li>Once your potatoes are mashed, put all the potatoes into a casserole dish</li>
    <li>Coat the potatoes with cheese, the crumbled bacon and green onions, as much as you like!</li>
    <li>Cook at 325 degrees until the cheese is melted and you're done!</li>
</ol>
